# Issue #1609 — Artifact Inventory

**Artifact type:** `OBSERVATIONAL_ARTIFACT`
**Mode:** repository lightweight closure / topology consolidation
**Runtime effect:** none
**Legitimacy-state effect:** none

## Scope and invariants

This inventory is a repository-wide cognition-mapping pass over documentation, issue-linked materials, governance artifacts, audit artifacts, closure artifacts, generated artifacts, and topology-classification artifacts. It does not introduce primitives, authority surfaces, execution pathways, runtime behavior, schema behavior, or legitimacy-state changes.

Preserved separations:

- Observation ≠ Authority
- Classification ≠ Enforcement
- Proposal ≠ Authority
- Capability ≠ Permission
- Understanding ≠ Correction

## Methodology and evidence boundary

This inventory uses repository-local evidence only: file topology, text search, filename families, and recent git-history adjacency. It intentionally does not resolve missing issue metadata through external authority and does not treat a search result as enforcement truth.

Evidence commands used during this closure pass:

- `rg --files -g '!node_modules' -g '!dist' -g '!build'`
- `find . -maxdepth 3 -type d -not -path './node_modules*' -not -path './.git*' -print`
- `rg -n "1752|1755|Topology Recovery|Observation Layer|Cognitive Interface|CIP" -g '!node_modules' -g '!package-lock.json' -g '!MINDSHIFT_REPO_OBJECTS.zip'`
- `rg -l "1752|1755|Topology Recovery Protocol|Observation Layer|Cognitive Interface Protocol|CIP" -g '!node_modules' -g '!package-lock.json' -g '!MINDSHIFT_REPO_OBJECTS.zip'`
- `git log --oneline -5`
- `git show --stat --oneline --name-only 6946465`

Interpretation rule: a repository-text marker is stronger than filename similarity; git-history adjacency is weaker than explicit artifact metadata; recommendations remain non-operative unless a later bounded implementation object adopts them.

## Artifact inventory

| Artifact | Category | Lineage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Recent issue lineage candidates

| Issue / concept | Explicit marker status | Best repository-local placement candidate | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1752 — Topology Recovery Protocol | No explicit text marker in current artifacts | `docs/protocols/topology-reasoning-protocol-v1.md`, `runtime_topology_inventory.md`, `runtime/topology/*`, `runtime/maps/*` | MEDIUM | Recent git history includes merge PR #1753 from a `session-1752` branch immediately before the topology reasoning protocol commit, so topology recovery lineage is present by adjacency but not by artifact metadata. |
| #1755 — Observation Layer and Cognitive Interface Protocol | No explicit text marker in current artifacts | `docs/observability-index.md`, `docs/observability-boundary-review.md`, `governance/topology/*`, `docs/canon/formal-cognition-lineage-canon-v1.md`, `docs/analysis/cognition-governance-closure-canon.md` | MEDIUM_LOW | Observation and cognition-interface concepts are present, but no single artifact declares #1755 or CIP terminology. |
| `Topology Recovery ⊂ Observation` | Not stated as a single index relation | Observation specs contain topology observation objects/emission/evidence precedence; topology reasoning is non-authoritative | MEDIUM | Semantically preserved, but navigation and issue lineage need annotation. |

## Duplicate candidates

| Duplicate family | Candidate artifacts | Closure note |
|---|---|---|
| Execution surfaces | Root canon plus classified derivatives in `EXECUTION_SURFACES_LINEAGE.json` | RESOLVED (#2303): `ROOT_CANONICAL`; derivative hashes and consumers are mechanically checked. |
| Bypass paths | `BYPASS_PATHS.json`, `governance/runtime/BYPASS_PATHS.json`, `runtime/bypass_paths.json`, `runtime/surfaces/BYPASS_PATHS.json`, validation-bundle copy | Declare canonical source and derivative copies. |
| Root authority inventories/rules | `governance/ROOT_AUTHORITY_INVENTORY.json`, `runtime/sovereignty/root_authority_inventory.json`, `governance/ROOT_AUTHORITY_CONTAINMENT_RULES.json`, `runtime/sovereignty/root_authority_containment_rules.json` | Preserve both domains if governance-vs-runtime distinction is real; otherwise annotate source-of-truth. |
| Schema copies | Root `schemas/*`, runtime `runtime/legitimacy/schemas/*`, governance PREO schema, namespace schemas | Add source lineage comments/docs; do not change schemas in this issue. |
| Invariant registry docs | `docs/invariant-registry.md`, `docs/governance/invariant-registry.md` | Clarify whether root is canonical and governance copy is scoped, or vice versa. |
| Cross-registry reconciliation names | `governance/cross_registry_reconciliation.json`, `governance/cross-registry-reconciliation.json` | Naming duplicate; canonical spelling unresolved. |
| Execution-surface map docs | `docs/topology/execution-surface-map.md`, `docs/topology/execution-surface-map.mmd`, `governance/runtime/EXECUTION_SURFACE_MAP.json` | Likely Markdown + Mermaid + JSON projection; add explicit projection relation. |

## Superseded / archival candidates

| Artifact | Classification | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `governance/topology/RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_INTELLIGENCE_PLANNING_SPEC.json` | SUPERSEDED/LINEAGE | Planning artifact appears upstream of #1641 classified observation and emission/evidence precedence specs. |
| `docs/analysis/*-analysis.md` date/frontier documents | ARCHIVAL_CANDIDATE after indexing | Many are discovery artifacts now partially formalized by canon/closure docs. Preserve as lineage, but index by phase. |
| `MINDSHIFT_REPO_OBJECTS.zip` | ARCHIVAL_CANDIDATE | Opaque root bundle with unclear generator/retention status. |
| `archive/session/*` | ARCHIVAL_CURRENT | Already archived; retain only if useful for provenance. |
| Root-level phase inventories (`PHASE3_*`, root `EXECUTION_SURFACES.json`, root `BYPASS_PATHS.json`) | MIXED | `EXECUTION_SURFACES.json` is root canonical; Phase 3 inventory is historical evidence; bypass authority is separately declared. |

## Orphaned / stale references

| Artifact | Finding | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/observability-index.md` | Stale internal links | Links to four missing docs: passive legitimacy observability layer, install-base telemetry, install-base compression, issue-853 issue graph cleanup. |
| Issue #1752 Topology Recovery Protocol | Unresolved explicit artifact marker | No explicit repository text marker found; git-history adjacency points to `docs/protocols/topology-reasoning-protocol-v1.md` and related topology inventory/runtime topology artifacts as placement candidates. |
| Issue #1755 Observation Layer + Cognitive Interface Protocol | Unresolved explicit artifact marker | No explicit repository text marker found; related observation/CIP concepts appear distributed across observability index, classified observation specs, and cognition canon docs. |
| `runtime-topology.json` | Generator ambiguity | Topology artifact exists at root but generator/relationship to `graph/runtime-topology.sample.json` is not declared in nearby docs. |
| Validation bundle copies | Generated lineage ambiguity | Bundle copies are likely generated derivatives; root source and regeneration command should be indexed. |

## Topology classification consistency notes

- Observation-layer artifacts are consistently non-authoritative where explicit (`docs/observability-index.md`, `runtime_topology_inventory.md`, `governance/topology/*`).
- Duplicate inventories are the main coherence risk: identical domain labels appear across root, governance, runtime, runtime/surfaces, and validation-bundle paths.
- Recent issue labels #1752 and #1755 are not visible in artifact names or contents, which makes lineage ambiguous even if the concepts are represented.
