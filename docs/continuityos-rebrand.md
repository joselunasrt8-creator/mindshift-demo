# ContinuityOS Rebrand

## 1) Why this repository is rebranding

This repository is rebranding to clarify product identity at the runtime layer:
- **ContinuityOS** names the operational runtime infrastructure.
- **MindShift** remains the canon and research umbrella.

This aligns project language with external positioning:

> ContinuityOS is distributed legitimacy infrastructure for execution-capable systems.

## 2) MindShift vs ContinuityOS relationship

- MindShift discovered the canon.
- ContinuityOS operationalizes it.
- MindShift remains the canon and research umbrella.
- ContinuityOS is the runtime substrate.

The repository now uses ContinuityOS-first naming for runtime surfaces while preserving MindShift references for canon lineage, ontology, and research origin.

## 3) Runtime naming map

Preferred runtime-facing naming:

- MindShift runtime → **ContinuityOS runtime**
- MindShift validator → **ContinuityOS validator**
- MindShift gateway → **ContinuityOS gateway**
- MindShift proof ledger → **ContinuityOS proof ledger**
- MindShift topology → **ContinuityOS topology**
- MindShift reconciliation → **ContinuityOS reconciliation**

Canon-facing naming that remains valid:

- MindShift canon
- execution ontology
- sealed canon artifacts
- research lineage
- foundational invariants

## 4) Terms that must not change

The following terms are canonical and must remain stable unless explicitly re-governed:

- AEO
- ATAO
- PREO
- SCO
- Omega Validator
- Proof-of-Transfer
- authority
- continuity
- reconciliation
- registry
- replay

## 5) Terms that may change

These surfaces can be updated during identity migration when semantics stay unchanged:

- project/repo branding text
- runtime-facing documentation labels
- package namespace planning labels
- repository description and metadata language

## 6) Migration stages

- **Stage 1 — Identity Layer:** README, security/contribution docs, package metadata, and top-level positioning become ContinuityOS-first.
- **Stage 2 — Documentation + Developer Surface:** developer docs adopt ContinuityOS runtime terminology while preserving MindShift canon references.
- **Stage 3 — Package / Namespace Preparation:** define package/module migration plan without destructive filesystem or import renames.

## 7) Non-goals

This rebrand does **not**:
- change runtime behavior
- change validator semantics
- change authority semantics
- change replay semantics
- change proof behavior
- alter database migrations
- create alternate execution paths
- imply deployment occurred

## 8) Canonical invariants preserved

All canonical invariants remain unchanged:

- If no valid object exists → nothing happens
- validated_object == executed_object
- authority-bound execution
- replay-safe execution
- proof-bound finality
- continuity lineage
- recursive reconciliation
- fail-closed semantics
- no bypass path

Runtime spine remains unchanged:

```text
/session
→ /continuity
→ /authority
→ /compile
→ /validate
→ /execute
→ /proof
```
