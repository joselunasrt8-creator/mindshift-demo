# Stage 2 Distributed Legitimacy Enforcement Plan v1

**Artifact Type:** Stage 2 Distributed Legitimacy Enforcement Plan  
**Status:** NON_OPERATIVE PLANNING ARTIFACT  
**Repository:** joselunasrt8-creator/mindshift-demo  
**Branch:** `claude/stage2-distributed-legitimacy-plan-2qUYH`  
**Date:** 2026-05-26

## Context

Stage 1 governed CI/CD enforcement was completed and merged via PR #1439 (2026-05-26), closing issues #1432–#1437. Stage 1 proved `validated_object_hash == executed_object_hash` within a single governed CI/CD surface.

Stage 2 must determine whether distributed legitimacy can remain deterministic when multiple validators, registries, proofs, replay records, topology observers, and reconciliation paths disagree under partial visibility, stale lineage, replay pressure, topology fragmentation, asynchronous reconciliation, partition conditions, and causal ambiguity.

This plan maps the existing substrate, defines the canonical state vocabulary, formalizes all required semantic models, sequences implementation slices, and identifies gaps. It does not implement, mutate, deploy, create authority, or claim distributed convergence is established.

---

## 1. Executive Determination

**Stage 2 Readiness Classification: PARTIAL**

### What Stage 1 Closed
- Governed execution hash binding enforcement (`validated_object_hash == executed_object_hash`) within one governed CI/CD surface
- Replay consumption registry runtime enforcement
- Governed proof artifact writer and persistence runtime
- Direct deploy bypass detection and audit runtime
- Local validator invocation adapter with VALID/NULL semantics
- Full CONF-CICD-01 through CONF-CICD-15 conformance suite

### What Stage 2 Must Now Prove
- Local correctness does NOT imply distributed legitimacy coherence
- `LOCAL_VALID` cannot silently become `GLOBAL_VALID` without topology-visible convergence evidence
- Consumed replay eligibility remains consumed across partition heal, reconciliation, and anti-entropy repair
- Conflict-set settlement preserves losing branch evidence
- Proof visibility does not create authority
- Reconciliation cannot create authority
- Epoch mismatch prevents `CONVERGENCE_VALID`
- All finality classifications remain recursively reconcilable

### What Must Remain NULL Until Distributed Convergence Is Established
- Execution eligibility under partition-local proof only
- `GLOBAL_VALID` classification without topology-visible quorum evidence
- `CONVERGENCE_VALID` without epoch binding
- Replay eligibility after any replay consumption event (including under partition or stale registry)
- Settlement finality without conflict-set evidence preservation

---

## 2. Stage 2 Scope Boundary

### Includes
- Distributed validator evidence (ValidatorAttestationEnvelope)
- Topology-visible finality classification (LOCAL_VALID / GLOBAL_VALID distinction)
- Partition-finality ambiguity model
- Distributed replay convergence and anti-entropy repair rules
- Proof-finality convergence (downgrade / upgrade events, append-only)
- Conflict-set detection, preservation, and settlement
- Epoch / settlement / convergence coupling
- Reconciliation state machine (OBSERVED → FINALIZED / NULL)
- Causal legitimacy clocks and happens-before ordering
- Cross-registry reconciliation determinism
- Revocation liveness downgrade propagation
- Stage 2 conformance matrix (CONF-DIST-01 through CONF-DIST-15)

### Excludes
- Production deployment
- Authority creation of any kind
- Consensus protocol implementation (separately scopeable)
- Hosted federation service
- Enterprise platformization
- Phase 3 external adoption (#1419–#1428)
- Distributed cognition convergence (#1416, #1407) — deferred to Phase 2+ or Phase 3

## 5. Canonical Stage 2 State Vocabulary

| State | Definition | Execution Implication |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| `GLOBAL_VALID` | Validated and executed across all visible topology with quorum attestation, within current epoch | Eligible for execution; all predicates satisfied |
| `LOCAL_VALID` | Validated and executed on a single governed CI/CD surface; global convergence not confirmed | Local execution only; NOT eligible for distributed finality claims |
| `PARTITION_VALID` | Valid within a single partition; global topology not visible | NOT eligible for global execution claims |
| `PARTITION_SUSPENDED` | Was valid; partition conditions detected; suspended pending resolution | NULL execution eligibility |
| `STALE_VISIBLE` | Epoch advanced or revocation propagated; observable but ineligible; terminal | NULL execution eligibility; evidence preserved |
| `AMBIGUOUS` | Topology visible but convergence evidence contradictory or incomplete | NULL execution eligibility |
| `OBSERVATIONAL` | Observed via topology; proof-binding not confirmed | NULL execution eligibility |
| `CONFLICTED` | Two or more competing legitimate roots; split-brain | NULL execution eligibility |
| `SETTLEMENT_CANDIDATE` | Deterministic winning candidate identified; settlement in progress | NULL until CONVERGENCE_VALID |
| `CONVERGENCE_VALID` | Topology-visible convergence confirmed; epoch valid; quorum evidence present | Eligible for GLOBAL_VALID promotion |
| `FINALIZED` | Executed; proof persisted; append-only log closed; epoch locked | Execution complete; replay permanently consumed |
| `NULL` | Any required invariant fails | Absolute prohibition on execution |

### Required Transition Guards
- `LOCAL_VALID` → `GLOBAL_VALID`: forbidden without passing through `CONVERGENCE_VALID` with topology-visible quorum evidence
- Any state → `GLOBAL_VALID`: requires topology_visible_convergence AND quorum_attestation AND epoch_valid AND no_conflicting_root AND causal_ordering_unambiguous
- `FINALIZED` → any valid state: forbidden (only `STALE_VISIBLE` allowed)
- `NULL` → any valid state: forbidden (new object required)
- `RECONCILING` → `FINALIZED`: forbidden (must pass through `CONVERGED`)

---

## 6. Local vs Global Legitimacy Semantics

```
LOCAL_VALID:
  validated_object_hash == executed_object_hash
  ∧ governed_cicd_surface_confirmed
  ∧ replay_safe_locally

GLOBAL_VALID:
  LOCAL_VALID
  ∧ topology_visible_convergence_confirmed
  ∧ quorum_attestation_present
  ∧ epoch_valid
  ∧ no_conflicting_root
  ∧ causal_ordering_unambiguous
```

### Required Rules
1. `LOCAL_VALID` cannot silently become `GLOBAL_VALID` — explicit topology-visible confirmation required
2. Partition-local validity cannot authorize global finality under any circumstances
3. Observational visibility cannot create any legitimacy state
4. Unresolved topology ambiguity must return `NULL` or `AMBIGUOUS`; never `GLOBAL_VALID`
5. No reconciliation, anti-entropy repair, or partition healing can elevate `LOCAL_VALID` to `GLOBAL_VALID` without fresh topology-visible quorum evidence
6. Causal ordering ambiguity prevents finality

---

## 7. Partition-Finality Ambiguity Model

### Partition Detection Inputs
- Topology visibility snapshot delta (node disappearance / unreachability)
- Quorum attestation gap (expected validators not responding)
- Epoch disagreement between topology nodes
- Competing legitimacy roots from diverged registry states
- Causal clock ordering inconsistency

### Finality Downgrade Conditions
- Any topology node unreachable → `GLOBAL_VALID` → `PARTITION_SUSPENDED`
- Competing root detected → `GLOBAL_VALID` → `CONFLICTED`
- Epoch advance without convergence → `GLOBAL_VALID` → `STALE_VISIBLE`
- Revocation event propagated → any valid state → `STALE_VISIBLE`
- Causal ordering becomes ambiguous → `CONVERGENCE_VALID` → `AMBIGUOUS`

### Finality Upgrade Conditions (must satisfy all)
- Full topology visibility restored AND quorum evidence collected AND epoch matches → path to `CONVERGENCE_VALID` → `GLOBAL_VALID`
- Settlement confirmed with losing-branch evidence preserved → path from `CONFLICTED` → `SETTLEMENT_CANDIDATE` → `CONVERGENCE_VALID`

### Stale Lineage Collapse
- Any lineage node whose epoch has advanced beyond current without renewal → `STALE_VISIBLE`; non-reversible; new object required

### Required Rule
Partition-local validity must not become global finality without topology-visible convergence evidence.

---

## 8. Distributed Replay Convergence Model

### Core Rules
- Once a nonce is consumed on any topology node, consumption propagates as an append-only event to all nodes
- On partition heal: union of all consumed sets = permanently consumed; no nonce is restored
- Anti-entropy repair propagates missing consumption events; it never un-consumes a nonce
- Replay resurrection attempt → `REPLAY_RESURRECTION` event → `NULL`
- Stale proof reuse detected during reconciliation → `STALE_PROOF_REUSE` → `NULL`
- Cross-registry replay record is the authoritative consumption source
- Reconciliation ordering must process replay consumption events before any execution eligibility determination

### Replay Conflict Classes
- `DUPLICATE_NONCE` — same nonce observed from multiple topology nodes
- `PARTITION_DIVERGENCE` — divergent consumption states after partition
- `STALE_PROOF_REUSE` — consumed proof re-submitted via stale registry
- `REPLAY_RESURRECTION` — attempt to use consumed nonce after partition heal or reconciliation

### Required Rule
Consumed replay eligibility is never restored by retry, proof reuse, reconciliation ambiguity, partition healing, or stale registry replay.

---

## 9. Validator Federation / Quorum Evidence Model

### ValidatorAttestationEnvelope (Candidate Object)
```typescript
interface ValidatorAttestationEnvelope {
  validator_id: string;
  epoch_id: string;
  object_hash: string;
  classification: FinalityClassification;
  topology_snapshot_hash: string;
  causal_clock: CausalClockVector;
  attestation_type: 'EVIDENCE' | 'OBSERVATION'; // never 'AUTHORITY'
  timestamp_utc: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

### Required Rules
- `attestation_type` must never be `'AUTHORITY'`
- Stale attestations (epoch mismatch) must be rejected
- Attestation from topology-invisible validator → `OBSERVATIONAL` only
- Quorum disagreement → `GLOBAL_VALID` blocked → `AMBIGUOUS` or `CONFLICTED`
- validator attestation evidence ≠ authority

---

## 10. Conflict-Set Settlement Model

### ConflictSetEnvelope (Candidate Object)
```typescript
interface ConflictSetEnvelope {
  conflict_id: string;
  detected_at: string;
  competing_roots: CompetingRoot[];
  winning_root?: string;
  losing_roots: string[];         // append-only; never deleted
  settlement_state: ConflictSettlementState;
  settlement_evidence: object;
  epoch_id: string;
}
```

### Required Rules
- All competing roots must be stored and preserved permanently
- No losing branch may be deleted or overwritten
- If no deterministic winner can be identified by causal ordering → `NULL`
- Competing roots with identical causal clocks → `NULL` (cannot settle deterministically)
- conflict settlement must preserve evidence, not erase losing branches

---

## 11. Distributed Proof-Finality Model

### ProofFinalityMetadata (Candidate Field)
```typescript
interface ProofFinalityMetadata {
  proof_id: string;
  finality_classification: FinalityClassification;
  topology_snapshot_hash: string;
  epoch_id: string;
  downgrade_events: ProofDowngradeEvent[];  // append-only
  upgrade_events: ProofUpgradeEvent[];       // append-only
  detached: boolean;
  detach_reason?: string;
}
```

### Required Rules
- Detached proof (no reconstructable continuity lineage) → `NULL`
- All downgrade/upgrade events appended to immutable arrays; never overwritten
- Proof exists but topology diverges → `AMBIGUOUS`
- Two proofs for same execution → `CONFLICTED`
- proof visibility ≠ authority
- proof existence ≠ distributed finality

---

## 12. Reconciliation State Machine

| State | Entry Condition | Exit Condition | Replay Implication | Proof Implication |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `OBSERVED` | Object seen on any node | Evidence accumulated | Replay eligibility unknown | Proof binding unconfirmed |
| `PENDING` | Reconciliation initiated; insufficient evidence | Evidence threshold or timeout | Suspended | Pending |
| `PARTITIONED` | Partition detected | Healed or timeout | Suspended; no restoration | Downgraded |
| `RECONCILING` | Active cross-registry traversal | Traversal complete | Consumed states preserved | Lineage reconstructing |
| `CONFLICTED` | Competing roots found | Settlement initiated or NULL | NULL | In conflict-set |
| `SETTLEMENT_CANDIDATE` | Deterministic winner identified | Settlement confirmed or rejected | NULL during settlement | Lineage converging |
| `CONVERGED` | Single root confirmed; topology agrees | Epoch binding confirmed | Consumed states propagated | Finality confirmed |
| `FINALIZED` | Epoch binding confirmed; GLOBAL_VALID | Epoch advance → STALE_VISIBLE | Permanently consumed | Finalized; append-only |
| `REVOKED` | Revocation received and propagated | Terminal | Permanently revoked | Revoked |
| `NULL` | Any required invariant fails | Terminal | NULL | NULL |

### Forbidden Transitions
- `FINALIZED` → any valid state
- `NULL` → any valid state
- `REVOKED` → any valid state
- `CONVERGED` → `GLOBAL_VALID` without epoch binding
- `RECONCILING` → `FINALIZED` (must pass through `CONVERGED`)
- Any state → `GLOBAL_VALID` without topology-visible quorum evidence

### Required Rule
The reconciliation state machine produces classifications, not authority. No state transition creates execution eligibility independently.

### Recommended New Issues (4)
1. **ValidatorAttestationEnvelope Definition and Non-Authority Attestation Constraints** — define typed envelope, non-authority guard, CONF-DIST-06 fixture
2. **ConflictSetEnvelope Definition and Losing-Branch Evidence Retention** — define typed envelope, losing-branch preservation, CONF-DIST-10 fixture
3. **Stage 2 Distributed Legitimacy Conformance Suite (CONF-DIST-01 through CONF-DIST-15)** — `conformance/suites/stage2-distributed-legitimacy-conformance.json`, all 15 fixtures, runner integration
4. **Revocation Liveness Downgrade Propagation Enforcement and CONF-DIST-12 Fixture** — wire `0051_revocation_liveness_registry` to finality classification; propagation enforcement

## 17. Recommended First Stage 2 PR

**Recommended first implementation PR:**  
`feat(stage2): finality classification registry hardening — LOCAL_VALID/GLOBAL_VALID distinction and CONVERGENCE_VALID state (Slice B)`

**Anchor issue:** #1340

**Supporting issues:** #1418, #1338, #1346

**Scope:**  
- Harden `src/lib/finality-classification.ts` to enforce LOCAL_VALID ≠ GLOBAL_VALID without topology evidence
- Add CONVERGENCE_VALID state to classification enum and registry
- Add epoch-binding check stub (for Slice C coupling)
- Add CONF-DIST-01 fixture: `tests/fixtures/stage2/local_valid_no_global_promotion.json`
- Add test asserting GLOBAL_VALID cannot be reached without topology evidence
- New migration for CONVERGENCE_VALID column if not in `0048`

**Non-goals:**  
No quorum evidence model, no reconciliation state machine, no distributed replay rules, no authority creation, no production deployment, no claim that distributed convergence is complete

**Expected tests:**  
- Extended `tests/fate/issue-1340-finality-classification-registry.test.mjs`
- New `tests/fate/stage2-conf-dist-01.test.mjs`
- No regression: `node conformance/runner.mjs` passes Stage 1 suite
