## Non-Runtime Artifacts Removed/Archived

### Closed Issues (not_planned — speculative/expansion)
- #569–#572: Speculative FATE/digital-twin additions
- #580: FATE expansion (would add new runtime routes — forbidden)

- #615–#618, #624–#629: Skill governance (non-operative)
- #630–#684: Agent/agentic governance expansion cluster
- #655–#671: Training/sim/research extraction issues

### Closed Issues (completed — superseded by spine PRs)
- #307 → #838 (sovereignty boundary)
- #356, #361 → #826 (workflow integrity)
- #357, #370 → #871 (read-only observability)
- #365, #368 → #885/#868 (conformance/lineage)
- #369 → #835 (reconciliation integrity)
- #435 → spine closure (#868–#885)

## Preserved Invariants

```text
runtime-critical work > conceptual expansion
transcript ≠ canon
archive evidence ≠ runtime authority
observability ≠ authority
telemetry ≠ proof
metrics ≠ execution permission
one invariant = one canonical issue
merged closure work must not remain open
if no valid runtime gap exists → close issue
```

## Validation

- Tests: 1068 passing, 0 failing
