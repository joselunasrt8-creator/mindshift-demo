**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Mode:** Non-operative. Derived exclusively from existing repository state and audit observations from issue #1605.

## Objective

Determine whether agent-mediated execution can be demonstrated to remain bounded by explicit authority, replay containment, proof lineage, and execution governance requirements.

|---|---|---|
| Agent execution surface inventory complete | TBD | |
| Agent bypass inventory complete | TBD | |
| ATAO specification complete | TBD | |
| AEO specification complete | COMPLETE | CANONICAL_AEO_IDENTITY_SPEC.md (#1691) |
| Authority binding specification complete | TBD | |
| Replay containment specification complete | TBD | |

## Agent Execution Surface Inventory

### Governed Surfaces

| Surface | Authority Requirement |
|---|---|
| Agent tool invocation | ATAO + AEO |
| Workflow dispatch | Authority-bound |
| Runtime execution request | Authority-bound |
| Deploy request | Governed path |

### External Surfaces

| Surface | Classification |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare deployment authority | BREAK_GLASS |
| GitHub administrative authority | BREAK_GLASS |
| Repository secret mutation authority | ROOT_AUTHORITY |

---

## Agent Bypass Inventory

| Bypass | Status |
|---|---|
| Direct deployment authority | OBSERVED |
| Root credential authority | OBSERVED |
| Local execution authority | OBSERVED |
| External infrastructure authority | OBSERVED |
| Agent execution without authority object | TBD |
| Agent execution without replay control | TBD |

## ATAO Specification

Required fields:

- intent
- authority
- scope
- constraints
- continuity binding
- replay binding
- proof requirement

**Status:** TBD

---

## AEO Specification

Required fields:

- intent
- scope
- validation
- target
- finality

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Specification:** CANONICAL_AEO_IDENTITY_SPEC.md

Defines:
- Canonical AEO schema (5-field, additionalProperties: false)
- ATAO → AEO transformation contract
- Canonical serialization rules (key-sorted, recursive)
- Identity anchor generation: `SHA-256(canonicalize(aeo))`
- Mutation invariant: immutable after hash binding
- Authority binding target: `aeo_registry(decision_id, validated_object_hash)`
- Ω Validator target: canonical AEO from `aeo_registry`
- Replay target: `invocation_registry(decision_id, validated_object_hash, invocation_nonce)`
- Proof target: `proof_registry(decision_id, validated_object_hash)`
- Reconciliation identity anchor: `deterministic_reconciliation_anchor` derived from `validated_object_hash` lineage

**Identity invariant:**
```
identity(validated_object) == identity(executed_object) == identity(proven_object) == identity(reconciled_object)
```

---

## Authority Binding Specification

Requirements:

- authority bound to execution object
- authority bound to scope
- authority bound to replay lineage
- authority bound to proof lineage

**Status:** TBD

---

## Replay Containment Specification

Requirements:

- replay identifier
- single-use execution eligibility
- lineage continuity
- replay invalidation
- reconciliation visibility

**Status:** TBD

---

## Proof Specification

Requirements:

- validated object = executed object
- lineage binding
- proof persistence
- reconciliation visibility
- auditability

**Status:** TBD

---

## Findings Relevant to Phase 3

Issue #1605 established:

- Deployment Exclusivity = OPEN
- Root Authority Surface = OBSERVED
- ROOT_AUTHORITY_CONTAINMENT_REQUIRED
- BREAK_GLASS authority exists outside repository governance

These findings affect execution-governance assumptions but do not independently satisfy Phase 3 closure requirements.

---

## Remaining Gaps

1. Complete ATAO specification.
2. Complete AEO specification.
3. Complete authority-binding specification.
4. Complete replay-containment specification.
5. Complete proof specification.
6. Complete agent bypass inventory.
7. Complete execution-surface inventory.

---

## Closure Recommendation

Current recommendation:

```text
PHASE 3 = OPEN
```

Reason:

Execution-governance primitives remain partially specified and residual execution authority surfaces remain under evaluation.

Phase 3 should not close until all closure criteria are satisfied and residual agent-execution ambiguity is resolved.

---

## Governance Distinction

```text
#1605 = authority topology determination
PHASE3_CLOSURE_MATRIX = execution governance determination
```

The former feeds the latter, but they are not the same closure object.

*No runtime mutation, validator behavior change, authority creation, proof generation,
registry mutation, reconciliation execution, topology mutation, deployment, merge, or
execution claim is implied by this document.*
