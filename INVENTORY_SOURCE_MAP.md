# INVENTORY_SOURCE_MAP

**Artifact type:** `OBSERVATIONAL_ARTIFACT`
**Artifact class:** `inventory_source_declaration`
**Mode:** documentation-only — source-of-truth annotation
**Runtime effect:** none
**Legitimacy-state effect:** none
**Authority created:** none
**Execution semantics changed:** none
**Issue scope:** duplicate inventory closure (GAP-004 prerequisite)

-----

## Purpose

Declare the canonical source for each duplicate inventory family in the repository.

This document resolves the split-canonical-source problem identified in `DRIFT_ANALYSIS.md` and `LIGHTWEIGHT_CLOSURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`. It does not mutate any JSON, schema, or runtime artifact. It does not create authority. It is evidence only.

Core invariant preserved:

```text
Ambiguous inventory source
→ unverifiable surface exhaustiveness
→ GAP-004 cannot close
→ NULL
```

-----

## Constraint

This document:

- annotates existing files
- declares source-of-truth per family
- marks non-canonical copies as generated / projection / legacy
- does not delete, merge, or modify any JSON file
- does not change any execution path
- does not change validation semantics

Non-operative remediation only. Mutation slices are separate bounded objects.

## Family 1 — EXECUTION_SURFACES

### Determination: `ROOT_CANONICAL`

`EXECUTION_SURFACES.json` is the single declared and operative authority. The selection is semantic rather than locational: it is the most complete current inventory, carries the issue-2280 capability metadata, identifies the canonical route chain, and was already consumed by runtime-governance and migration enforcement tests. The previous topology was split: merge topology reconciliation consumed `runtime/surfaces/EXECUTION_SURFACES.json`, runtime discovery declared `governance/runtime/EXECUTION_SURFACES.json`, closure tests and regeneration consumed `runtime/execution_surfaces.json`, constitutional review required `governance/execution_surfaces.json`, while other enforcement tests consumed the root file.

All enforcement consumers now read the root canonical file. `EXECUTION_SURFACES_LINEAGE.json` classifies every remaining family member and binds its origin, source version, generation method, and verified content hash. `scripts/validate-execution-surfaces-authority.mjs` fails when a first-party code or workflow consumer names a non-canonical family member, when lineage is incomplete, or when a derivative changes without an explicit freshness update.

| File | Classification | Operative status |
|---|---|---|
| `EXECUTION_SURFACES.json` | **canonical source (`ROOT_CANONICAL`)** | Sole enforcement authority |
| `governance/runtime/EXECUTION_SURFACES.json` | compatibility copy | Non-operative; retained for its legacy schema |
| `runtime/surfaces/EXECUTION_SURFACES.json` | generated projection | Evidence-only topology projection; not authority |
| `runtime/execution_surfaces.json` | compatibility copy | Non-operative issue-342 schema |
| `governance/execution_surfaces.json` | retired artifact | Retained, but prohibited as an enforcement input |
| `governance/mindshift-validation-bundle/governance/EXECUTION_SURFACES.json` | generated projection | Validation-bundle export; not authority |
| `PHASE3_EXECUTION_SURFACE_INVENTORY.json` | historical evidence | Phase-closure evidence; not current authority |

The inventories remain semantically different. This reconciliation does **not** merge, union, or silently mutate their surface arrays. Any future semantic convergence requires a separate governed change. Declared canonical authority is therefore distinguished from operative consumption, and generated projection is explicitly distinguished from independent authority.

### Specialized Bypass Path Files (Legitimate Decomposition — Not Duplicates)

These files are topically scoped decompositions, not copies:

|File                                        |Classification                             |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|`runtime/constitutional_bypass_paths.json`  |`CURRENT` — constitutional governance scope|
|`runtime/delegation_bypass_paths.json`      |`CURRENT` — delegation chain scope         |
|`runtime/distributed_bypass_paths.json`     |`CURRENT` — distributed topology scope     |
|`runtime/federated_bypass_paths.json`       |`CURRENT` — federation scope               |
|`runtime/runtime_mutation_bypass_paths.json`|`CURRENT` — runtime mutation scope         |
|`runtime/state_bypass_paths.json`           |`CURRENT` — state transition scope         |
|`runtime/temporal_bypass_paths.json`        |`CURRENT` — temporal governance scope      |


> These specialized files represent distinct bypass surface domains. They are not duplicates of the master inventory. They should be explicitly referenced from the canonical `BYPASS_PATHS.json` as domain decompositions to prevent future misclassification.

## Consumer → Canonical Source Map

Summary for all confirmed runtime consumers:

## Split-Source Problem Statement (GAP-004 Blocker)

```text
merge-governance-check.yml
→ EXECUTION_SURFACES.json (root canonical, v1.0)

src/index.ts
→ EXECUTION_SURFACES.json (root canonical, v1.0)

These files have diverged.
No single file is authoritative for both consumers.
Surface exhaustiveness cannot be verified against a split ground truth.
GAP-004 closure requires convergence to a single canonical source.
```

Resolution path (Slice 2 — separate bounded implementation object):

- Determine which file is source-of-truth (likely `runtime/surfaces/` given it is the more complete, versioned, generated artifact)
- Update `src/index.ts` to load from the same source as `merge-governance-check.yml`
- Or: produce a single merged canonical file and update both consumers
- Constraint: do not alter surface content without explicit governance scope

## Foundational Separations Preserved

|Separation                  |Status                                                                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Observation ≠ Authority     |Preserved — this document is evidence only                                     |
|Classification ≠ Enforcement|Preserved — annotation does not alter validator behavior                       |
|Proposal ≠ Authority        |Preserved — source declarations do not grant execution permission              |
|Capability ≠ Permission     |Preserved — identifying canonical sources does not create execution eligibility|
