# ContinuityOS

ContinuityOS is distributed legitimacy infrastructure for execution-capable systems.

ContinuityOS is the runtime infrastructure project derived from the MindShift canon.

MindShift remains the canon and research umbrella.
ContinuityOS is the runtime substrate.

ContinuityOS governs whether state-changing actions are permitted to exist before execution occurs.

Core invariant:

```text
If no valid object exists
→ nothing happens
```

---

# Canonical Runtime Flow

```text
/session
→ /continuity
→ /authority
→ /compile
→ /validate
→ /execute
→ /proof
```

All state-changing execution surfaces are expected to route through this lifecycle.

---

# Core Principles

ContinuityOS runtime is built around:

- deterministic validation
- exact-object discipline
- replay resistance
- fail-closed behavior
- proof persistence
- non-bypassable execution boundaries
- authority integrity
- continuity lineage

Canonical invariant:

```text
validated_object == executed_object
```

Mutation after validation is considered a boundary violation.

---

# Repository Governance

Repository mutation governance is enforced through:

- Apache-2.0 licensing
- CODEOWNERS
- SECURITY.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- governed pull request flow
- deterministic validation expectations

Direct mutation paths that bypass review/governance are considered invalid architecture.

---

# Contribution Model

ContinuityOS accepts bounded, reviewable contributions that preserve canonical invariants.

See:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `CODEOWNERS`

---

# Positioning

Canonical external statement:

```text
ContinuityOS is distributed legitimacy infrastructure for execution-capable systems.
```

Execution gate:

```text
VALID ∧ AUTHORIZED ∧ UNUSED ∧ POLICY_VALID
∧ REPLAY_SAFE ∧ TOPOLOGY_VISIBLE
∧ RECONCILABLE ∧ EPOCH_VALID ∧ CONVERGENCE_VALID
```

ContinuityOS does not replace intelligence. It enforces legitimacy before execution.

MindShift discovered the canon.
ContinuityOS operationalizes it.

# External Demo: Portable Legitimacy Conformance Evidence

This repository contains a portable conformance harness demonstrating that
legitimacy observability infrastructure can operate outside the canonical runtime
with minimal dependency friction.

## What this demonstrates

- Conformance pack-v1 executes with no dependency on the canonical runtime
- Governance evidence artifacts are emitted deterministically
- CI-visible evidence is published on every pack-relevant change
- Governance vocabulary is portable before runtime adoption occurs

## What this does NOT demonstrate

- Runtime legitimacy
- Authority issuance
- Execution permission
- Distributed proof finality
- Deployment

## Running the conformance harness

Requirements: Node.js >= 18, shell.

```bash
node conformance/pack-v1/harness.mjs
```

or via the runner script:

```bash
./scripts/run-conformance.sh
```

Expected output (all vectors passing):

```
CONFORMANCE_EVIDENCE_OBSERVED
VALIDATION_FAIL_CLOSED_CONFIRMED
REPLAY_CONSUMPTION_PRESERVED
PROOF_APPEND_ONLY_CONFIRMED
CONVERGENCE_CLASSIFICATION_CORRECT
PACK_V1_CONFORMANCE_COMPLETE
```

Evidence artifact written to: `conformance/pack-v1/conformance-pack-v1-evidence.json`
Reference snapshot at: `evidence/latest.json`

# Governance Boundary

```text
conformance evidence  ≠  authority
badge                 ≠  execution permission
observability         ≠  legitimacy
fixture pass          ≠  runtime governance
visibility            ≠  legitimacy
```

The conformance harness is:

- **Evidence-only** — it reads static fixtures and emits structured output
- **Non-operative** — it does not create authority, perform deployment, or mutate runtime state
- **Fail-closed** — if any vector fails, the harness exits non-zero and CI fails

The purpose is observability, comparability, and governance vocabulary portability.
Not runtime governance, authority issuance, or distributed proof finality.

# Install-Base Interpretation

Install base is **not**:

- stars
- downloads
- chatbot usage
- prompts

Install base **is**:

```text
workflow dependency
+
execution dependency
+
governance dependency
```

Install-base expansion starts when external systems depend on your governance vocabulary
before they depend on your runtime.

This repository is the first external proof that legitimacy observability infrastructure
is portable — demonstrating governance vocabulary can become an external dependency
surface before runtime adoption occurs.
