# MindShift

MindShift is Execution Ontology Infrastructure.

MindShift governs whether state-changing actions are permitted to exist before execution occurs.

Core invariant:

```text
If no valid object exists
→ nothing happens
```

---

# Canonical Runtime Flow

```text
/authority
→ /compile
→ /validate
→ /execute
→ /proof
```

All state-changing execution surfaces are expected to route through this lifecycle.

# Core Principles

MindShift is built around:

- deterministic validation
- exact-object discipline
- replay resistance
- fail-closed behavior
- proof persistence
- non-bypassable execution boundaries
- authority integrity
- continuity lineage

Canonical invariant:

```text
validated_object == executed_object
```

Mutation after validation is considered a boundary violation.

---

# Repository Governance

Repository mutation governance is enforced through:

- Apache-2.0 licensing
- CODEOWNERS
- SECURITY.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- governed pull request flow
- deterministic validation expectations

Direct mutation paths that bypass review/governance are considered invalid architecture.

---

# Contribution Model

MindShift accepts bounded, reviewable contributions that preserve canonical invariants.

See:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `CODEOWNERS`

# Positioning

Compressed:

```text
AI scales cognition.
MindShift scales legitimacy.
```

MindShift does not replace intelligence.

MindShift governs legitimacy before execution.
